# map-pinpoint-app

I created this project to play with React Native and Expo to create my own app.

The idea for the project came from a friend that reported the company app he works didn't has a good navigation and the pins presented are outdated without an option the update or add new ones. 


## Installation

It's quite simple to run the app:
 - Clone or download the app to some folder
 - run ```npm install```
 - After every dependency is installed run ```npm run android```


## To Do:

- [x] Create an autocomplete component to do the search;
- [X] Show where the user is on the map;
- [X] Be able to render the pins in every city;
- [ ] Add JSdocs to every file
- [ ] Add an smooth effect to center the map on the user's position;
- [ ] use Google Cloud Plataform to store the data and make the application pull it from the server, not just load from a file;
- [ ] Implement a screen to update or add new locations;
- [ ] Refactor the Picker component so the placeholder don't appear as an option to choose;
